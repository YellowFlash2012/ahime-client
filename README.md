# ahime-client
Client side of a full stack ecommerce project

# Key learning points:
1- Didn't know about bootswatch before. Heard about it here first time.
https://bootswatch.com/

2- how to set default props value in a component without receiving the props from the parent component, e.g stars color in the Rating components

3- how to specify the type of each prop using PropTypes. Its effects are only visible in the console of the devtools not in the UI.
4- learned thta for a component like cart, it needs to be rendered under 2 options: either from the single-product page or directly by clicking on "cart" in the navbar. Therefore, under RRDV6, 2 routes are needed in the app.js file to fully render the cart.
