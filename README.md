Client side of a full stack ecommerce project

#Key learning points:
1- Didn't know about bootswatch before. Heard about it here first time.
https://bootswatch.com/

2- how to set default props value in a component without receiving the props from the parent component, e.g stars color in the Rating components

3- how to specify the type of each prop using PropTypes. Its effects are only visible in the console of the devtools not in the UI.
